# Recommendation Model for Educational Courses

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a recommendation model for educational courses, based on the Llama 2 model. The goal of the project is to suggest courses to users by analyzing the data stored in a JSON file containing course information and metadata. The recommendations will be displayed in a format similar to the example provided in the attached project plan.

## Key Features
- **Course Recommendation**: The model suggests courses tailored to user preferences and needs.
- **Integration with Llama 2**: Utilizes the power of Llama 2 for natural language understanding and enhanced recommendation logic.
- **JSON Data Handling**: Reads and processes course data stored in a JSON file.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Recommendations are displayed in a structured and visually appealing format.
